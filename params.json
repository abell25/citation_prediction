{"name":"Citation prediction over the NIPS dataset","tagline":"","body":"### Project Overview\r\nThe high-level goal of this project is to create an automated system to find interesting papers in a conference.   The first major step is predict citation counts since this is a powerful indicator of the community's general interest in a paper.  We are specifically looking at the NIPS conference, scraping nearly 30 years of pdfs from the nips website and extracting citation information from these documents.\r\n\r\n### Current Research\r\nCurrently we are extracting citations by doing a text search of each paper's title over the entire corpus minus the paper of interest as well as the first and last names of any of the authors to reduce the number of false positives for short titles in particular.  We then split the papers into a training and test set and calculated various citation based features for each of the authors of our corpus for the training set.  We also calculated citation features based on co-author citation features.  This gave us an author-feature matrix.  The train and test document sets were converted into document-author matrices where index ij is one if document i includes author j as one of it's authors.  These two matrices were matrix multiplied with the author-feature matrix to generate document-feature matrices for the train and test set.  We used these final matrices as the train and test set, where the labels to predict are the citation counts for each document.\r\n\r\n### Notes on the dataset\r\nThe citations follow an exponential distribution, where the vast majority are less than 10 and most are 0.  Log mean citation counts per author seems to be the more important feature for prediction.  Running the script in the repo will download and generate the dataset as a json object that will be saved locally for future use.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
