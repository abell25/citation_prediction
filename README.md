# Construction of citation prediction dataset from the nips dataset.

This git repo is for a project of predicting citations for a machine learning independent study I took.  The papers were scraped from the nips website and citations were constructed by searching for titles in the papers (transformed from pdf to text).

Method 1: NLP methods - performs horribly
Method 2: Learning with an author-paper matrix - pretty
Method 3: Citation features - generating a paper-feature matrix - performed decent
